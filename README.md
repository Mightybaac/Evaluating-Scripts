In this version, I added a struct ScriptEvaluation to hold the evaluation criteria, conversion rate, customer satisfaction and appointments generated by each script. I also added a function evaluateScript(const std::string& script) which takes a script as an input and returns the evaluation criteria.
Then I added a map scriptEvaluations to store the evaluation results of each script.

In the last part of the code, I added a calculation to find the script with the highest score based on the three evaluation criteria, conversion rate, customer satisfaction, and appointments generated. I used a weighted average to calculate the score with the weight 60% for conversion rate, 30% for customer satisfaction and 10% for appointments generated.
You can adjust the weights and criteria as per your requirements. Also, you can add other evaluation criteria and adjust the code accordingly
